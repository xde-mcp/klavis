# What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that unifies how AI models communicate with external tools and services. It acts as a bridge between Large Language Models (LLMs) and the real world, enabling AI agents to interact with databases, APIs, files, and other systems in a standardized way.

## How MCP Works

MCP follows a simple **client-server architecture**:

- **MCP Client**: The AI assistant or application (like Claude Desktop, Cursor, or your custom AI agent)
- **MCP Server**: A specialized backend that exposes tools to interact with external systems
- **Tools**: Individual functions that the AI can call to perform specific actions

    C -->|Result| B
    B -->|Context| A
```

## MCP Server Types

### Hosted MCP Servers (Recommended)
Klavis AI provides **production-ready hosted MCP servers** that eliminate setup complexity:

- No infrastructure management
- Built-in OAuth authentication
- Automatic updates and maintenance
- 99.9% uptime SLA

```python
from klavis import Klavis

klavis = Klavis(api_key="your-api-key")
server = klavis.mcp_server.create_server_instance("GMAIL", "user123")
```

### Self-Hosted MCP Servers
For custom requirements or on-premises deployments:

```bash
# Run any MCP server with Docker
docker run -p 5000:5000 ghcr.io/klavis-ai/gmail-mcp-server:latest
```
